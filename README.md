## Summary

Our class was given this project to do as our "midterm". The requirements that were given was to make something that can control five (5) Hue Lights and at least two (2) Wemo outlets. 
My interpretation of this request was to make a central console that would allow you to individually select each Hue light, their color, and their brightness. I also set it up to individually 
select each Wemo outlet to turn on or off. There is a requirement as well to have an external source turn on a "automated" mode. For this requirement, a mercury tilt switch as been added. When
the desk box is shaken or is moved suddenly, it will turn on all lights to blue and the screen will show "CALM DOWN".
